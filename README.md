# [ Master I | MIAGE ] Technology Monitoring : Babylon.js and VSCode Extension

This project aims to create an autocomplete extension for Babylon.js thanks to the [Language Server Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide) provided by VSCode. 

## What is [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) ?

JavaScript API designed to render interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser, without the use of any plug-ins.

## What is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ?

VS Code is a type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.
